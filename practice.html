    <div class="row">
  <div class="panel panel-default col-lg-4">
    <div class="panel-heading">Rachel</div>
    <div class="panel-body"> She gets her energy from interacting with her friends because she doesn’t like to be on her own.  She works in the fashion industry so it’s only natural for her to act this way. </div>
    <div class="panel-footer">My boss wants to buy my baby</div>
  </div>
  <div class="panel panel-default col-lg-4">
    <div class="panel-heading">Ross</div>
    <div class="panel-body"> As the only introverted character, Ross is somewhat shy and keeps to himself- especially during his college years when interacting with Rachel, his secret crush. It is no surprise that Ross is highly agreeable, as demonstrated by his compassion, trust and generosity.</div>
    <div class="panel-footer">That sandwich was the only good thing in my life and someone ate it.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="panel panel-default col-lg-4">
    <div class="panel-heading">Joey</div>
    <div class="panel-body"> He could not be a more extroverted individual. He constantly thrusts himself into new social situations because of his occupation as an actor. He is very comfortable with talking to others, even though what he says may not make any sense.  </div>
    <div class="panel-footer">I'm curvy and I like it.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="panel panel-default col-lg-4">
    <div class="panel-heading">Chandler</div>
    <div class="panel-body">  He always seems to have some unusual ideas brewing in his mind that stem from external factors and he likes to focus on what the future holds, choosing to avoid his past and family life.</div>
    <div class="panel-footer">I'm a pretty little girl</div>
  </div>
  <div class="panel panel-default col-lg-4">
    <div class="panel-heading">Phoebe</div>
    <div class="panel-body">Phoebe is one of those people who could talk to anyone about anything. She gets her energy through talking and singing about the abstract ideas and theories she comes up with. Like Chandler, she is very spontaneous in all aspects of her lifestyle. </div>
    <div class="panel-footer">If it's a girl, Phoebe and if it's a boy, Phoebo</div>
  </div>
  <div class="panel panel-default col-lg-4">
    <div class="panel-heading">Monica</div>
    <div class="panel-body">She definitely draws her energy from others and her constant desire to control and manage her friends’ actions. Rachel even puts her in charge of her love life, which Monica happily takes on because of her personal belief that she knows more about Rachel than Rachel herself does.  </div>
    <div class="panel-footer">We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes.</div>
